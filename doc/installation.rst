Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lmfit works with `Python`_ versions 3.5 and higher. Version
0.9.15 is the final version to support Python 2.7.

Lmfit requires the following Python packages, with versions given:
   * `NumPy`_ version 1.16 or higher.
   * `SciPy`_ version 1.2 or higher.
   * `asteval`_ version 0.9.16 or higher.
   * `uncertainties`_ version 3.0.1 or higher.

All of these are readily available on PyPI, and should be installed
automatically if installing with ``pip install lmfit``.

In order to run the test suite, the `pytest`_ package is required. Some
functionality requires the `emcee`_ (version 3+), `corner`_, `pandas`_, `Jupyter`_,
`matplotlib`_, `dill`_, or `numdifftools`_ packages. These are not installed
automatically, but we highly recommend each of these packages.

For building the documentation and generating the examples gallery,
`matplotlib`_, `emcee`_ (version 3+), `corner`_, `Sphinx`_,
`jupyter_sphinx`_, `Pillow`_ and `ImageMagick`_ are required (the
latter one only when generating the PDF document).

Please refer to ``requirements-dev.txt`` for a list of all dependencies that
are needed if you want to participate in the development of lmfit.

Downloads
~~~~~~~~~

The latest stable version of lmfit is |release| and is available from `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lmfit/>`_. Check the `release_notes`_ for a list
of changes compared to earlier releases.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to install lmfit is with::

    pip install lmfit

For Anaconda Python, lmfit is not an official package, but several
Anaconda channels provide it, allowing installation with (for example)::

   conda install -c GSECARS lmfit

or::

   conda install -c conda-forge lmfit


Development Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get the latest development version from the `lmfit GitHub repository`_, use::

   git clone https://github.com/lmfit/lmfit-py.git

and install using::

   python setup.py install

We welcome all contributions to lmfit! If you cloned the repository for this
purpose, please read `CONTRIBUTING.md`_ for more detailed instructions.

Testing
~~~~~~~

A battery of tests scripts that can be run with the `pytest`_ testing framework
is distributed with lmfit in the ``tests`` folder. These are automatically run
as part of the development process.
For any release or any master branch from the git repository, running ``pytest``
should run all of these tests to completion without errors or failures.

Many of the examples in this documentation are distributed with lmfit in the
``examples`` folder, and should also run for you. Some of these examples assume
that `matplotlib`_ has been installed and is working correctly.
